# Pokémon Type Graph

## Description
This project explores Pokémon type advantages and disadvantages through the lens of **network theory**.  
By treating types as nodes and effectiveness relationships as connections, the project creates a way to visualize and understand the balance of the Pokémon type system across different generations.  
It is inspired by the idea of seeing type matchups not just as tables, but as an interactive network.

## Aims
- Provide a tool where users can input attacking and defending types to see **how advantageous** one is against the other.  
- Represent Pokémon type interactions as a **graph**, allowing free exploration of strengths, weaknesses, and immunities.  
- Support **multiple generations**, showing how type relationships and overall balance have evolved over time.  
- Build a foundation for a **website** where people can explore and compare type networks in an intuitive way.
